    Dear {{Request.first_name}}

    My name is Carmelle and I’m the Customer Service Manager at Custom Tattoo Design. Thank you for choosing us for your design. I thought you might want a few tips when it comes to working with us and some insight into our process.

    - Share your feedback: When you get back your first sketch, you’ll hopefully love it! But sometimes adjustments need to be made. This is just a part of the design process. The best thing you can do is be as clear as you can when discussing what you like and don’t like about a design. This will help your artist get the changes right the first time so you can get your tattoo design done quickly and beautifully. Don’t be scared to share criticism, we're professionals and being blunt just helps make the process easier and better for you.  We’re all nice people we get it :)

    - Try and respond in a reasonable time: You’re excited. You’re eager. You’re also busy and making time to respond to your artist can sometimes get pushed lower on the priority list. But creating a one of a kind, custom tattoo design is a collaborative process and the faster you can provide feedback to your artist, the quicker you’ll get your design completed.

    - Tattoo designs and tattoo shops: It’s really important not to get impatient when you make a decision about getting a tattoo. Almost all of us get really excited and want to get a new tattoo today! Truth is that tattoo designs take much longer to design than they do to get the actual tattoo; taking into consideration all the changes, thoughts and design elements. Most reputable tattoo shops have waiting lists, sometimes several months, for good cause.

    ** TIP *** If you are itching to get into a great tattoo shop, ask to wait on a cancellation list when booking your future appointment. When customers cancel and the tattoo artists will call you to fill the missed session. This can drop your wait times and allow you to get into a great tattoo shop quickly.

    If you have any other questions about the design process, feel free to reach out and we’ll be happy to help you out. Thanks again for choosing Custom Tattoo Design and we look forward to getting you a great looking tattoo.

    Sincerely,

    Carmelle Krasevec

    Hi {{Request.first_name}},

    Thank you for sending us your half sleeve idea. Our design team really likes your concept and I know we can do something amazing for you. Before we start your sleeve I wanted to let you know we only allow our senior tattoo artists and design team to work on tattoo sleeve designs. Tattoo sleeves take 30 - 40+ hours of drawing time to complete and we appreciate you trusting us with such a large and personal design. Let me tell you how our sleeve process works;

    In order to start the design process we require a 50% deposit of the total design cost. In order to make sure you're 100% satisfied, we have a money back guarantee until you approve your first draft. Once the deposit has been paid we will place you in order and assign you the best artist for your design style and needs. Your artist will contact you for an introduction before you get started,  as things can get very busy this can take 2- 3 days however we will always stay in contact with you. Throughout the process your artist will send you links via email where you can review your design privately and ask your artist for any revisions or changes you would like to make. Once the final piece is complete and you are 100% happy with your design, you’ll make the final 50% payment and we will send your final design in high resolution straight to your inbox. The biggest difference between us and anyone else is that you own your design.  We will give you the copyrights to the design once it's complete and will never reuse or resell your design.

    Based on the size and complexity of your design the deposit to begin your {{Request.size}} design is: {{Variant.price}} USD.

    Use the link below and we will get started as soon as possible.

    Here is the link to complete your {{Variant.price}} USD deposit:
    [CLICK HERE TO MAKE YOUR DEPOSIT]({{Variant.cart_redirect_url}})

    All our transactions are protected for our customers; you can use PayPal, any major credit card and we're now accepting Visa Debit.

    Color, Cover ups and Tattoo Integrations have additional charges which you can add before checkout.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with you. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email me back.

    I look forward to hearing from you,
