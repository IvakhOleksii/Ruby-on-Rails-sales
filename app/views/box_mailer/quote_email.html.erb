  Hi <%= @request.first_name.try(:titleize) %>,

<p>
  In order to start the design process we require a 50% deposit of the total design cost. To make sure you're satisfied,
  keep in mind we have a money back guarantee until you approve your first draft. Once the deposit has been paid we
  will place you in order and assign you the best artist for your design style and needs. Your artist will contact you
  for an introduction before you get started. Because of the size of your design and the limited amount of senior
  designers your design may take 5- 7 days to start, however, we will always stay in contact with you. You will receive
  a link via e-mail where you can review your design privately and ask your artist for any revisions or changes you
  would like to see.
</p>

<p>
  Once the final piece is complete and you are 100% happy with your design, youâ€™ll make the final 50% payment and we
  will send your final design in high resolution straight to your inbox. The biggest difference between us and anyone
  else is that you own your design and we have professional artists on staff.
</p>

<p>
  Based on the size and complexity of your design the deposit to begin your <%= @request.size %> design is:
  <%= number_to_currency @variant.price, precision: 0 %> USD. Use the link below and we will get started as soon as
  possible.
