  <p>Dear <%= @request.first_name.titleize %>,</p>

  <p>
    My name is Kayla and I’m the Customer Service Manager at Custom Tattoo Design. Thank you for choosing us for your
    design. At this point, your design idea is pretty clear to you, but to make the process of working with our artists
    easier, our team decided to sit down and give you our best tips for creating great tattoo designs with our artists.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You might get asked for some more detail from your assigned artist: If you, like many of our customers, have spent
      hours searching the internet for the perfect design, sent in your request and images, but are now working with an
      artist who asks for more info, don’t let that get you down. We try and provide our artists with enough detail when
      we first work on your quote but sometimes they need a little extra to get you the best design possible. Their goal
      is to learn as much about you as they can to ensure they give you exactly what you want.
    </li>
    <li>
      Share your feedback: When you get back your first sketch, you’ll hopefully love it! But sometimes adjustments need
      to be made. This is just a part of the design process. The best thing you can do is be as clear as you can when
      discussing what you like and don’t like about a design. This will help your artist get the changes right the first
      time so you can get your tattoo design done quickly and beautifully.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try and respond in a reasonable time: You’re excited. You’re eager. You’re also busy and making time to respond to
      your artist can sometimes get pushed lower on the priority list. But creating a one of a kind, custom tattoo design
      is a collaborative process and the faster you can provide feedback to your artist, the quicker you’ll get your
      design completed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tattoo designs and tattoo shops: It’s really important not to get impatient when you make a decision about getting
      a tattoo. Almost all of us get really excited and want to get a new tattoo today! Truth is that tattoo designs take
      much longer to design than they do get the actual tattoo; taking into consideration all the changes, thoughts and
      design elements. Most reputable tattoo shops have waiting lists, sometimes several months, for good cause.
      <br/>

      ** TIP *** If you are itching to get into a great tattoo shop, ask to wait on a cancellation list when booking your
      future appointment. When customers cancel and the tattoo artists will call you to fill the missed session. This
      can drop your wait times and allow you to get into a great tattoo shop quickly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have any other questions about the design process, feel free to reach out and we’ll be happy to help you out.
    Thanks again for choosing Custom Tattoo Design and we look forward to getting you a great looking tattoo.
