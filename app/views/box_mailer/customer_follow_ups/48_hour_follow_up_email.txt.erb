Dear <%= @request.first_name.titleize %>,

We completely understand how difficult it can be to come up with the perfect idea for a tattoo. If it wasn’t hard you wouldn’t be working with Custom Tattoo Design. Our team decided to sit down and give you our best tips for creating great tattoo designs with our artists.

- Find a style you like: If you, like many people, have spent hours searching the internet for the perfect design without any luck, don’t stress. What you should really be looking for is a style of tattoo you like. A couple of examples would be American Traditional tattoos, Japanese styles or new trends like trash polka and geometric. Once you have style of tattoo you like, save a few photos and share them with your artist. This saves many hours of design time and lets us match up the perfect artist for you right off the bat.

- What’s in the design: If you’re not sure what to put in the design, take some time to think about your hobbies, places you have been, memories you cherish, or people you love and admire.  In most cases you can tie those thoughts together to come up with some cool ideas or elements. A simple example could be someone who loves swimming and their rainy hometown. If you come up with the elements, it’s our job to bring them together into something great.

- Tattoo designs and tattoo shops: It’s really important not to get impatient when you make a decision about getting a tattoo. Almost all of us get really excited and want to get a new tattoo today! Truth is that tattoo designs take much longer to design than they do get the actual tattoo; taking into consideration all the changes, thoughts and design elements. Most reputable tattoo shops have waiting lists several months in advance sometimes more.

** TIP *** If you are itching to get into a great tattoo shop, ask to wait on a cancellation list rather than book a set appointment.  When customers cancel and the tattoo artists are sitting around they will call to fill the missed session.  This can drop your wait times and allow you to get into a great tattoo shop quickly.

If you have any other questions about the design process, feel free to reach out and we’ll be happy to help you out. Thanks again for choosing Custom Tattoo Design and we look forward to getting you a great looking tattoo.

Sincerely,
