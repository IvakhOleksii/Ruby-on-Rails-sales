Hi <%= @request.first_name.try(:titleize) %>,

<%= render @quote_template_path %>

In order to start the design process we require a 50% deposit of the total design cost. In order to make sure you're 100% satisfied, we have a money back guarantee until you approve your first draft. Once the deposit has been paid we will place you in order and assign you the best artist for your design style and needs. Your artist will contact you for an introduction before you get started,  as things can get very busy this can take 2- 3 days however we will always stay in contact with you. Throughout the process your artist will send you links via email where you can review your design privately and ask your artist for any revisions or changes you would like to make. Once the final piece is complete and you are 100% happy with your design, youâ€™ll make the final 50% payment and we will send your final design in high resolution straight to your inbox. The biggest difference between us and anyone else is that you own your design.  We will give you the copyrights to the design once it's complete and will never reuse or resell your design.

Based on the size and complexity of your design the deposit to begin your <%= @request.size %> design is: <%= number_to_currency @variant.price, precision: 0 %> USD.

Use the link below and we will get started as soon as possible.

All our transactions are protected for our customers; you can use PayPal, any major credit card and we're now accepting Visa Debit.
