Hi <%= @request.first_name.try(:titleize) %>,

Thank you for visiting our site, I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on your new sleeve idea. I did happen to noticed you had put in a request for a full sleeve but haven't put down a deposit to get your artwork started. In the past, the upfront cost of a full sleeve has held people back and sometimes hinder them from moving forward. Often times it can be many other items however we are the largest sleeve design company in the world so I know cost seems to be the most likely objection.

One suggestion that has been going really well for us is starting with a half sleeve design. It can be a great way to get start your sleeve meanwhile saving nearly 30% less cost upfront. Once you have your half sleeve, you can always come back to us in the future and we can finish it up. Furthermore you can book your half sleeve and pay for it much faster with your tattoo artist. Let me know what you think, I would love to help you if I can.

I take improving my business very seriously and I am always appreciative of feedback. If your reason for not moving forward is something I can help with, Iâ€™d love to hear it.

Thanks again for your time

Cheers,
