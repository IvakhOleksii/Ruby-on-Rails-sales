Hello <%= @request.first_name.try(:titleize) %>,

I noticed you were on our site and you sent us a design request for a free quote.  Whether it was price, timing or something we did you decided not to do your design with us.  If you don't mind letting me know whatâ€™s keeping you from working with us, I will do my best to help you.  I'm so passionate about my business and each customer that I want to make sure I have done everything I can to help.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or if there is anything you feel I can do to help earn your business.

Feel free to use my personal email below to respond so I can do my best make our business and your experience better.

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you,
