	<p>Thank you for deciding to work with Custom Tattoo Design! We put together this quick one page article so that you know exactly what to expect over the next few days.  One of the best parts of working with Custom Tattoo Design is that we strive to keep you up to date and informed at all times, so you never have to worry about what’s happening with your design.  Below is a brief description of the design process and exactly what you will receive once the process is complete.  Again, we want to thank you for your business and to remind you that you can contact us anytime via live chat, phone or email as our customer service is open 24 hours a day. </p>
	<p>So you just made your deposit!  Congrats and here is what you can expect over the following days:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Your design request is now in our queue system.  Our art director Jen will review the size and complexity of your design and match you up with the best possible artist for your design needs. Depending on how busy we are and the availability of the appropriate artists for your design, this can take 1-5 days.  Don’t worry, we haven’t forgotten about you! 
		</li>
		<li>
			Once your artist has been assigned they will email you personally prior to starting the design.  This is a good time to let them know if you have any more thoughts, changes to your original design description, or ideas to discuss before starting your initial sketches.  They may have some simple questions about the exact location of the design or how you would like to see it laid out.  
		</li>
		<li>
			Once your initial sketches are ready we send them over to our graphic design team.  This can take anywhere from 1-24 hours.  The graphic designer will watermark the design and send you a link where you can view your design privately.  
			<ul>
				<li>
					Note:  Once you see your initial sketches please contact your artist directly with any changes or thoughts you might have. This is the time for any major revisions; if you want to change the layout, add elements, or if you want to go in a different direction all together. We allow up to 3 revisions of the sketches for free.  If you love the direction your design is going, please just let them know to continue to the next step. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			After you have approved a sketch and asked your artist to move to the final shaded version of the design you will see a more complete and detailed version. It is at this time that you would make any minor changes, as the design is nearly complete.  Again, be sure to communicate with your artist so that you’re happy with everything in the design. If you need help explaining your ideas or you have any questions regarding the art work, our art director is always available to help.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ok so you love the design, now what?  Please let your artist know that the design is perfect; at this point your artist will contact us to send you the final payment link.  Once you make the final payment we will send you all of the items listed below directly to your email.  This process can take up to 24 hours as the design team will convert your design to High Definition and create your graphic layover.  
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>What to expect with your final Custom Tattoo Design! </p>

	<ul>
		<li>A fully detailed version of your dream design in High Definition available to print and resize as you wish.</li>
		<li>Graphic layover: See the final design on your body or on one of our models so you know exactly how amazing your new ink will look!</li>
		<li>Certificate of Authenticity:  We provide you the copyrights for this design; we cannot and will not resell or redistribute your design idea.  This is your original tattoo for life.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Things to keep in mind:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>In the initial sketch phase we allow a maximum of 3 revisions for free.  Remember, each piece of artwork is custom and can take 10-50 hours depending on the size and complexity. Your artist is committed to making sure that you absolutely love the design! Please be sure to communicate clearly with your artist so they can create the design to your specifications.  (Additional revisions can be purchased through customer service if absolutely necessary).</li>
		<li>Check your Junk Mail:  Depending on your email settings, your artist’s initial email or the link to view your sketches may end up in your junk folder. This is not usually an issue, however, please be sure to take a look if you feel that no one has contacted you in some time.</li>
		<li>Money Back Guarantee:  We will refund your money 100% until you pass your initial sketch phase (your first set of sketches).  Once the artist has created your first set of sketches and you have asked them to continue, it’s now our job to make it perfect! However we also have to pay our artist’s for their time and effort. The money back guarantee is void after you have asked your artist to move onto your next set of sketches (second revision)</li>

		<li>Customer Service:  We pride ourselves on amazing customer service. If, for any reason, you are not happy or you need to communicate with a manager, please just send our customer service manager a request at  Kayla@customtattoodesign.ca   </li>
	</ol>

	<p>We truly appreciate your business and look forward to working with you. We can’t wait to help you turn your dream into reality!</p>
