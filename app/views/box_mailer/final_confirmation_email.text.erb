Hi <%= @request.first_name.try(:titleize) %>,

I noticed your final design has been completed. I think the final product looks great and I wanted to personally say thank you for your business and your time. We will have your final documents over to you as soon as possible.

I am really passionate about my business and I like to ask everyone that finishes a design with us for their comments and any feedback they might have to help improve the business and/or customer experience. If you had a great experience and are open to sending me a testimonial, I would be extremely grateful.

Again, I really appreciate your business and I hope you had a great experience with us! I look forward to hearing from you again.

Feel free to contact me anytime,

Lee Roller
